Each microservice is wrapped in a Docker container for light-weight portability and rapid development. 
They can be deployed stand-alone or with fault-tolerant queues running on Apache Mesos with Marathon for massive scalability 
and high availability. These services are designed for SaaS deployment and are fully multi-tenant aware.
